# Decentralized-Identity-Blockchain
A simple decentralized blockchain implementation focused on managing digital identities and verifiable credentials.
This project demonstrates a basic Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain with peer-to-peer synchronization, transaction signing using ECDSA, Merkle trees for integrity, and a Flask-based API for interacting with the chain.
It's designed for educational purposes to showcase how blockchain can be used for secure, tamper-proof identity management, such as issuing and verifying credentials (e.g., certifications or user verifications).
